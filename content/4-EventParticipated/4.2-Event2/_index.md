# AI-Driven Development Workshop – Shaping the Future of Development

**Venue:** AWS Event Hall, 26th Floor – Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City  
**Time:** 14:00 – 16:30, Friday, October 3, 2025  
**Speakers:** Mr. Toan Huynh, Ms. My Nguyen  
**Coordinators:** Diem My, Dai Truong, Dinh Nguyen

### Event Objectives

- Share new trends in AI-orchestrated software development (AI-Driven Development).
- Introduce AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) framework – a model integrating AI throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Demonstrate two important tools: Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE Extension.
- Analyze how AI enhances productivity, speed, and software product quality.
- Guide the future role of AI in modern software development.

### Content and Highlights

#### 1. Opening – Shaping the Future of Software Development

Mr. Toan Huynh opened with the theme "Shaping the Future of Development", emphasizing the shift from traditional development models to AI-Orchestrated Development – where AI plays a supporting role, orchestrating processes from planning, design, programming to testing and deployment.

#### 2. Challenges in Current Development Models

AI-Assisted Development and AI-Managed Development models still have limitations: lack of stability, difficult to explain, not truly achieving the promise of "AI acceleration".
From there, the speaker introduced the concept of AI-Driven Development (AI-DD) – an approach that balances automation and human control.

#### 3. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) Model

AI-DLC is divided into three evolutionary levels:

- **AI-Assisted Development**: AI supports code generation, suggestions, syntax checking.
- **AI-Driven Development**: AI participates in architecture design, planning and decision support.
- **AI-Managed Development**: AI automatically orchestrates development processes with human approval.

In this model, AI plays the role of "intelligent coordinator", while developers retain decision-making authority and responsibility for output verification.

#### 4. Benefits of AI in Software Development

According to the "AI in Development – Outcomes" presentation, AI integration brings seven outstanding benefits:

- **Predictability**: Maintain progress and help businesses accurately predict release schedules.
- **Velocity**: Accelerate time-to-market for ideas.
- **Quality**: Reduce errors and improve software stability.
- **Innovation**: Inspire new ideas and approaches.
- **Developer Engagement**: Increase programmer interest and work efficiency.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enhance user experience and satisfaction.
- **Productivity**: Reduce development time, increase overall efficiency.

#### 5. Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

According to the "Where are developers spending time in the SDLC?" diagram, the development process includes stages:
Explore & Plan → Create → Test & Secure → Review & Deploy → Maintain, Transform & Modernize.

AI helps shorten time in labor-intensive stages like testing, deployment and maintenance through automation and intelligent analysis.

#### 6. Standard AI-DLC Process

The "AI-DLC Standard Development Workflow" slide presents four core steps of the standard development process:

- **Requirement**: Product Owner collects and analyzes requirements.
- **Design**: Software Architect designs architecture, processes and APIs.
- **Implementation**: Software Engineer implements, tests and integrates.
- **Deployment**: Deploy and monitor the system.

AI supports all four stages, making the process more consistent, clear and efficient.

#### 7. AI-DLC Process Characteristics

According to the "Key Workflow Features" slide, the process has main characteristics:

- **Role Separation**: Clear separation between business – architecture – implementation.
- **AI-Enhanced**: Each role has its own AI context, suitable for expertise.
- **Iterative**: Continuous feedback loops between stages.
- **Template-Driven**: Standardize outputs with unified AIDLC templates.

#### 8. AI in Each Development Stage

The "Each Stage" slide clearly describes how AI is integrated:

- **Specific Context**: Each role (PM, Architect, Developer) has its own AI persona.
- **Clear Inputs/Outputs**: Clearly define inputs – outputs between steps.
- **Interactive Approach**: Support collaboration and parallel feedback between AI and humans.
- **Documentation**: Continuously update documents like prompts.md, dashboard.md to track progress and improve models.

#### 9. Live Demo: Amazon Q Developer and Kiro IDE

**Amazon Q Developer**
- AI assistant integrated in IDE (VS Code, Cloud9...).
- Automatically generates code, tests, writes documentation and suggests AWS architecture.
- Supports updating prompt.md and automating CI/CD processes.
- Live demo illustrates ability to create development plans, write user stories and manage projects through AI commands.

**Kiro IDE** (presented by Ms. My Nguyen)
- IDE extension that helps create and manage specification documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md).
- AI can create feature descriptions, define API flows, generate backend code.
- Demo illustrates the process of creating a Chat application with user authentication using AI, including login, registration and token handling.

### Key Takeaways

- AI doesn't replace programmers, but becomes a "smart teammate" supporting them at every stage.
- The AI-DLC model helps standardize processes, ensuring transparency and consistency in software development.
- Amazon Q Developer helps save time, reduce errors and support automated testing – deployment.
- Kiro IDE demonstrates AI's comprehensive support capability from specification to code generation.
- Integrating AI into DevSecOps is an inevitable trend to achieve high productivity and ensure security.

### Practical Applications

- Apply Amazon Q Developer to automate testing and create documentation in internal projects.
- Use Kiro IDE to standardize specification processes and write backend code quickly.
- Organize AI-Driven sprints to evaluate AI effectiveness in software development teams.
- Deploy "AI-Assisted Code Review" model to optimize product quality.

### Personal Reflection

The "AI-Driven Development Workshop" was an in-depth and practical experience.

Mr. Toan Huynh's presentation on AI's role in the future of software development was highly directional, helping me better understand the relationship between AI and humans in the development process.

Ms. My Nguyen's live demonstration with Kiro IDE was a highlight, clearly showing how AI can support programmers from writing specifications to automated code generation.

The event helped me deeply realize that AI is not just a support tool, but a strategic platform helping businesses innovate faster, more accurately and more sustainably.
