#### Migration & Modernization Track:

- Case study on migrating large-scale workloads to AWS.
- Amazon Q Developer demo showcasing automated software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Sessions on application modernization and security in the AI era.

#### Technical Sessions:

- Roadmap for VMware modernization to AWS (EKS, RDS, serverless).
- Large-scale security approaches, from development to production, enhanced by GenAI analysis.

### Key Learnings

- Always start with business needs, then select the right technology.
- Migration requires a clear, phased roadmap rather than a one-time move.
- Amazon Q Developer has strong potential to accelerate SDLC.
- Security must be integrated from the beginning (security by design).

### Application to My Work

- Organize event storming sessions with the team to identify practical GenAI use cases.
- Experiment with Amazon Q Developer within the current workflow.
- Apply phased migration in cloud projects.
- Integrate DevSecOps to ensure security throughout the development lifecycle.

### Personal Experience

This was my first time attending Vietnam Cloud Day, and it left a strong impression:

- Hearing directly from CEOs and CTOs provided real insights into the local challenges and opportunities.
- The GenAI panel was highly practical, highlighting diverse perspectives while reinforcing the importance of aligning AI with business strategy.
- The Amazon Q Developer demo provided a clear picture of how GenAI can accelerate software development.
- Networking with experts and other builders offered valuable opportunities to exchange ideas and experiences.

### Takeaways

- GenAI is powerful, but success ultimately depends on people and strategy.
- Migration requires a well-defined roadmap—rushing is counterproductive.
- Cloud + AI will become the foundation for business growth in Vietnam.
- Builders must continuously learn and remain open to experimenting with new tools.
